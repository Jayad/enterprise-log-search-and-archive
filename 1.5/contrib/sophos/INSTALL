From Chris Wakelin:

I'm running Ubuntu 10.04's (net-)snmpd on the ELSA node with

SNMPDRUN=no
TRAPDRUN=yes
TRAPDOPTS='-p /var/run/snmptrapd.pid -m ALL -Ls6 -Ot'

in /etc/default/snmpd

(to log to Syslog Local6 with timestamps as integers to make matching
the Uptime one easier, particularly as it appears to be wrong, 10x the
size perhaps, in Sophos!)

and the Sophos MIB copied to /usr/share/snmp/mibs

I've got

authCommunity log <"secret" community string>
doNotRetainNotificationLogs yes

in /etc/snmpd/snmptrapd.conf

(Funnily enough, putting the Logging and Output options in the
snmptrapd.conf produces slightly different output behaviour; this may be
fixed in later versions of net-snmp)

I've got an /etc/rsyslog.d/11-sophos-snmp.conf file containing
local6.*                    @127.0.0.1 # forward to ELSA syslog-ng

I've got an extension to the schema and patterndb.xml (attached):

In practice, I don't think I can get all the fields in my schema out,
just IP, hostname and notices for now.
