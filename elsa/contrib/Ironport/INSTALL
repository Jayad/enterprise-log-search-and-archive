The current method for collecting correlated messages from Ironport is a bit tricky and involves the addition of a second logging process to separate correlated message from uncorrelated messages.  Below is an example showing how to configure an rsyslog process to run alongside syslog-ng.  Many thanks to C. Martinez for this work.

When rsyslog instance receives logs from Ironport devices, these are
redirected to the first syslog-ng instance (in my working
configuration is under syslog-corr), as you can see in this config
file.

When logs are processed and correlated by syslog-corr instance, these
are forwarded to syslog-ng ELSA's instance:

rsyslog -----> syslog-corr -----> syslog-ng ELSA.
