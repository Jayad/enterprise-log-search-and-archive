	# Tuning for number of indexes the system will handle.  There are temporary indexes which are (by default) 60 second batch-loaded indexes which get consolidated when the total number of logs in temporary indexes is over the setting for "perm_index_size."  By default, ELSA will consolidate its temporary indexes when it hits 10 million or temporary indexes are more than 40% of 200 (80).  If 200 permanent indexes are used before it hits the log size capacity, then it will prematurely overwrite permanent indexes.  Therefore, if you do not collect 10 million logs in less than 200 minutes, you will lose logs because they are overwritten prematurely.  So, if your logging rate is less than 833.3 logs per second, you will want to increase the number of indexes.
